# Computational-Resource-Scheduling
codes on multi-task learning applied to computational resource allocation for intelligent edge IoT devices

Given a computational workload on the network, the first task is to decide whether to perform all computation locally or to share the computation load among edge devices.
This is a binary classification task.
The second task is to determine the proportion of computational resources to be shared among the edge devices. this is a regression task
Together this forms the multi-task learning problem, and both onjectives are simultaneously minimized in the multi_task model
